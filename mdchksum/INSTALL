This is a simple program; it's build-process should be similar.  There is no
configure script.  To make the program, one can simply run
make && sudo make install

or
make && sudo make PREFIX=/path/to/prefix INSTALL

PREFIX defaults to /usr/local if unspecified.

The file ``mdchksum'' will be built and placed into PREFIX/bin, and nothing
else will happen.  Uninstallation of the program is as simple as
sudo rm `which mdchksum`
