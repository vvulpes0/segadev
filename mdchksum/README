mdchksum (Version 1.2)
========

The program is used to verify and fix checksums on Sega Genesis / Mega
Drive rom images using the standard Sega algorithm.  Currently, the
program does not check that it is actually being run against a rom
file, so be sure to only use the -f (fix) option on something that is
actually a rom.

There are two types of Sega Genesis / Mega Drive rom files; mdchksum
only supports one.  The first type, which is supported, is known as a
raw / BIN file.  The other is an SMD.  The file's extension may be
lying, though.  To verify that the rom in question is supported, if
you are running a Unix-like OS, run (replacing <rom> with the path to
your rom):

    od -An -tc -j256 -N16 <rom>

It should return either "SEGA GENESIS" or "SEGA MEGA DRIVE".  If it does
not, it is probably an SMD format rom, and needs to be converted first.

There are no plans to support compressed rom images; it is trivial to
decompress, fix, and recompress the rom.
