mdchksum Version 1.0
========
The file ``LICENSE'' is automatically generated from the compiled program.
If you care what license is used, the function ``print_license'' in the
file ``mdchksum.c'' contains the full text of the license.  It should be
the last function in the file.
========
The program is used to verify and fix checksums on Sega Genesis / Mega Drive
rom images using the standard Sega algorithm.  Currently, the program does
not check that it is actually being run against a rom file, so be sure to
only use the -f (fix) option on something that is actually a rom.

There are two types of Sega Genesis / Mega Drive rom files; mdchksum only
supports one.  The first type, which is supported, is a raw / BIN file.
The other is an SMD.  The file's extension may be lying, though.  To
verify that the rom in question is supported, if you are running a Unix-
like OS, run (replacing <rom> with the path to your rom):

head -c 272 <rom> | tail -c 16; echo

It should return either "SEGA GENESIS" or "SEGA MEGA DRIVE".  If it does
not, it is probably an SMD format rom, and needs to be converted first.

There are no plans to support compressed rom images; it is trivial to
decompress, fix, and recompress the rom.
