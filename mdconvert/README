mdconvert is not a program in and of itself.  Each subdirectory of this one
contains a small program useful in converting Sega Genesis / Mega Drive roms
between various formats.  When mdconvert is built and installed, it is really
each of these small programs that are being made.  mdconvert itself is a
shell script used to drive these small programs.

Each individual program does one thing:
 * bin2hilo: Split a BIN formatted rom to two files, one for the high-order
             bytes, and one for the low-order bytes
 * bin2smd:  Convert a BIN formatted rom to SMD format
 * s128k:    Split a BIN formatted rom into Megabit-sized files (128 kB)
             of even / odd bytes.
 * smd2bin:  Convert an SMD formatted rom to BIN format

The driver program can be invoked as
mdconvert <ACTION> <INFILE> [<OUTFILES>]
where <ACTION> is one of
 * convert:  Convert a rom of one format to the other
 * hilo:     Split a rom to high-order and low-order byte files
 * s128k:    Split a rom to Megabit even / odd files
 * type:     Attempt to detect the type of a rom

If <ACTION> is ``hilo'' and <INFILE> is SMD formatted, a temporary file
is made containing a conversion of <INFILE> to BIN format, then the
rom is split from there.
